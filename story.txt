Jim is a cute dog and has a lot of friends. One day, he called his friends Kate and Jack to go to the forest. They had a great time playing hide and seek in the forest. However, when they decided to go back home, they met two snakes. Jim is afraid of snakes, so he chose to hide behind his friends. Fortunately, Kate and Jack beat snakes together, and all of them went home happily.

Until, they came across an even bigger snake. This snake would take all three of them to swindle their way past. Kate and Jack both distracted the snake while Jim went past, and Jim got past the snake. Then it was Jim's turn to distract the snake for Kate and Jack to slip by. They did and continued to walk happily.

The second day, they went to school and shared their adventure story to their friends. All their friends said they are very brave.
