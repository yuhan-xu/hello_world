Jim is a cute dog and has a lot of friends. One day, he called his friends Kate and Jack to go to the forest. They had a great time playing hide and seek in the forest. However, when they decided to go back home, they met two snakes. Jim is afraid of snakes, so he chose to hide behind his friends. Fortunately, Kate and Jack beat snakes together, and all of them went home happily.
